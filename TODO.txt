TODO:
	- C++ rewrite (for learning and efficiency); see cpp_version/
    - Add additional options to tag_album.py
        - Print parsed metadata from album_info as soon as constructor has finished
        - Don't print ffmpeg output when converting files to mp3
    - Add option to set cover per track, not just album wide, in atd files
    - Add CLI to organize album music files within an atd file, then tag the album. Or some easier way to quickly rename song files to fit better in .atd.
